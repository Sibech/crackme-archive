# crackme-not

By: weissi1994

Description: This is the first crackme i ever created, also the first piece of asm code i ever wrote, as you can take from the name, it grew from a hello-world example. I still would rate it as difficulty 2 since most level 1 crackmes are kind of obvious to solve once you open them in some debugger.

The program takes a username and a password. It then adds 0x5 to the username, and that becomes the correct password. Example solution is `username: 1` and `password: 5`.
